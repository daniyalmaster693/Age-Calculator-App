<h2> What have I learned </h2>

<li> Improved my knowlege about HTML input elements </li>
<li> Improved my responsive design skills </li>
<li> Learned about built in Javascript functions such as: new Date(), getDate(), getFullMonth(), getFullYear(), and more </li>
<li> Learned how to use things like classlist.add and remove to dynamically change the styles of elements </li>

<h2> How did I complete this project? </h2>

<p> I started by creating all the HTML elements and assigning them classes. Next, I started to work on the card, where I added a box shadow, set the height and width propeties, added the border properties, and changed some small things like margin and padding. Then, I moved onto the inputs, where I worked on small detials like the border radius, outline and border colors, fonts and more. Now, I worked on the result CSS, where I changed the color of the span, made the font style italic, and set some small properties. I also worked on the HR, where i changed the color, and the calculate button, where I positioned and scaled the image. Next, I moved onto the Javascript part of the project, where I defined the variables for elements. Then, I created elements for the different values of things in the script, such as age values and more. I defined some parameters for my calculate function, that would tell the Javascript engine what to do and display, based on if the day value was more or less then the current value. I also created a function for the errors, where I set the styles based on what was typed into the Input. Once I finished, I tested the website on multiple browsers, added some responsive design using media queries, and used the built-in device size emulation feature to view what the website would look like on different devices. </p>
